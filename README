This is regarding the Twilio SMS Notifications script for OpenEMR thet I'm working on and am pleased to let you know that
it's now complete and we've thoroughly tested it and it's working fine.

This project has been made using OpenEMR 4.1.1 (patch11) as the base.

In respect to the project, I've just got some important notes:

Files Modified:

    /var/www/openemr/library/globals.inc.php
    /var/www/openemr/modules/sms_email/reminder/cron_sms_notification.php

Files/Directories Added:

    /var/www/openemr/modules/sms_email/reminder/sendnotifications.php
    /var/www/openemr/modules/sms_email/reminder/twilio

Cron for the script:

    Can be set to run every hour
    Command:
    wget -q --spider http://IP_NUMBER/openemr/modules/sms_email_reminder/cron_sms_notification.php
    change IP_NUMBER in above command to IP Number of OpenEMR on which the twilio script is running

SMS Body:

    This is now in the cron_sms_notifications.php file on line 141 and should be edited there as required.

Attached also are report files showing what changes have been made to 'globals.inc.php' and 'cron_sms_notification.php'.

Pls contact me for more info.
